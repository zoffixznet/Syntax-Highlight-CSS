Syntax-Highlight-CSS

The module takes CSS code and wraps different pieces of syntax into
HTML C<< <span> >> elements with appropriate class names which enables
you to highlight syntax of the snippet using.. CSS ^_^

I honestly suggest you to try L<Syntax::Highlight::Engine::Kate::CSS>
first and see if it does what you want. Personally, I found that it
wasn't interpeting C<@media> blocks properly, but I could've been
DoingItWrong. In constrast, with L<Syntax::Highlight::Engine::Kate::CSS>
you will be able to differentiate between B<more> syntax elements than
with this module.
